Projectivity of \overline{M}_g

This document is an exposition of Koll\'ar's proof that the coarse moduli space
\overline{M}_g of stable curves of genus g, g â‰¥ 2, is projective. In particular,
this implies that the space \overline{M}_g, which may just be an algebraic
space, is in fact a projective variety.

This document was largely written at the Stacks Project Workshop at the
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, which took place between July 31 and August
4, 2017. This is written by Raymond Cheng, Yordanka Kovacheva, Carl Lian, Monica
Marinescu, and Takumi Murayama with guidance from Davesh Maulik.
